Toolbars
A toolbar provides convenient access to frequently used commands, controls, navigation, and search.

A toolbar consists of one or more sets of controls arranged horizontally along the top or bottom edge of the view, grouped into logical sections.

Toolbars act on content in the view, facilitate navigation, and help orient people in the app. They include three types of content:

The title of the current view

Navigation controls, like back and forward, and search fields

Actions, or bar items, like buttons and menus

In contrast to a toolbar, a tab bar is specifically for navigating between areas of an app.

Best practices
Choose items deliberately to avoid overcrowding. People need to be able to distinguish and activate each item, so you don’t want to put too many items in the toolbar. To accommodate variable view widths, define which items move to the overflow menu as the toolbar becomes narrower.

Note

The system automatically adds an overflow menu in macOS or iPadOS when items no longer fit. Don’t add an overflow menu manually, and avoid layouts that cause toolbar items to overflow by default.

Add a More menu to contain additional actions. Prioritize less important actions for inclusion in the More menu. Try to include all actions in the toolbar if possible, and only add this menu if you really need it.

Standard
Compact

In iPadOS and macOS apps, consider letting people customize the toolbar to include their most common items. Toolbar customization is especially useful in apps that provide a lot of items — or that include advanced functionality that not everyone needs — and in apps that people tend to use for long periods of time. For example, it works well to make a range of editing actions available for toolbar customization, because people often use different types of editing commands based on their work style and their current project.

Reduce the use of toolbar backgrounds and tinted controls. Any custom backgrounds and appearances you use might overlay or interfere with background effects that the system provides. Instead, use the content layer to inform the color and appearance of the toolbar, and use a ScrollEdgeEffectStyle when necessary to distinguish the toolbar area from the content area. This approach helps your app express its unique personality without distracting from content.

Prefer using standard components in a toolbar. By default, standard buttons, text fields, headers, and footers have corner radii that are concentric with bar corners. If you need to create a custom component, ensure that its corner radius is also concentric with the bar’s corners.

Avoid using a segmented control in a toolbar. Segmented controls let people switch contexts, whereas a toolbar’s actions are specific to the current view. For guidance, see Segmented controls.

Consider temporarily hiding toolbars for a distraction-free experience. Sometimes people appreciate a minimal interface to reduce distractions or reveal more content. If you support this, do so contextually when it makes the most sense, and offer ways to reliably restore hidden interface elements. For guidance, see Going full screen. For guidance specific to visionOS, see Immersive experiences.

Titles
Provide a useful title for each window. A title helps people confirm their location as they navigate your app, and differentiates between the content of multiple open windows. If titling a toolbar seems redundant, you can leave the title area empty. For example, Notes doesn’t title the current note when a single window is open, because the first line of content typically supplies sufficient context. However, when opening notes in separate windows, the system titles them with the first line of content so people can tell them apart.

Don’t title windows with your app name. Your app’s name doesn’t provide useful information about your content hierarchy or any window or area in your app, so it doesn’t work well as a title.

Write a concise title. Aim for a word or short phrase that distills the purpose of the window or view, and keep the title under 15 characters long so you leave enough room for other controls.

Navigation
A toolbar with navigation controls appears at the top of a window, helping people move through a hierarchy of content. A toolbar also often contains a search field for quick navigation between areas or pieces of content. In iOS, a navigation-specific toolbar is sometimes called a navigation bar.

Use the standard Back and Close buttons. People know that the standard Back button lets them retrace their steps through a hierarchy of information, and the standard Close button closes a modal view. Prefer the standard symbols for each, and don’t use a text label that says Back or Close. If you create a custom version of either, make sure it still looks the same, behaves as people expect, and matches the rest of your interface, and ensure you consistently implement it throughout your app or game. For guidance, see Icons.

Actions
Provide actions that support the main tasks people perform. In general, prioritize the commands that people are most likely to want. These commands are often the ones people use most frequently, but in some apps it might make sense to prioritize commands that map to the highest level or most important objects people work with.

Make sure the meaning of each control is clear. Don’t make people guess or experiment to figure out what a toolbar item does. Prefer simple, recognizable symbols for items instead of text, except for actions like edit that aren’t well-represented by symbols. For guidance on symbols that represent common actions, see Standard icons.

Prefer system-provided symbols without borders. System-provided symbols are familiar, automatically receive appropriate coloring and vibrancy, and respond consistently to user interactions. Borders (like outlined circle symbols) aren’t necessary because the section provides a visible container, and the system defines hover and selection state appearances automatically. For guidance, see SF Symbols.

Use the .prominent style for key actions such as Done or Submit. This separates and tints the action so there’s a clear focal point. Only specify one primary action, and put it on the trailing side of the toolbar.

Item groupings
You can position toolbar items in three locations: the leading edge, center area, and trailing edge of the toolbar. These areas provide familiar homes for navigation controls, window or document titles, common actions, and search.

Leading edge. Elements that let people return to the previous document and show or hide a sidebar appear at the far leading edge, followed by the view title. Next to the title, the toolbar can include a document menu that contains standard and app-specific commands that affect the document as a whole, such as Duplicate, Rename, Move, and Export. To ensure that these items are always available, items on the toolbar’s leading edge aren’t customizable.

Center area. Common, useful controls appear in the center area, and the view title can appear here if it’s not on the leading edge. In macOS and iPadOS, people can add, remove, and rearrange items here if you let them customize the toolbar, and items in this section automatically collapse into the system-managed overflow menu when the window shrinks enough in size.

Trailing edge. The trailing edge contains important items that need to remain available, buttons that open nearby inspectors, an optional search field, and the More menu that contains additional items and supports toolbar customization. It also includes a primary action like Done when one exists. Items on the trailing edge remain visible at all window sizes.

To position items in the groupings you want, pin them to the leading edge, center, or trailing edge, and insert space between buttons or other items where appropriate.

Group toolbar items logically by function and frequency of use. For example, Keynote includes several sections that are based on functionality, including one for presentation-level commands, one for playback commands, and one for object insertion.

Group navigation controls and critical actions like Done, Close, or Save in dedicated, familiar, and visually distinct sections. This reflects their importance and helps people discover and understand these actions.

Keep consistent groupings and placement across platforms. This helps people develop familiarity with your app and trust that it behaves similarly regardless of where they use it.

Minimize the number of groups. Too many groups of controls can make a toolbar feel cluttered and confusing, even with the added space on iPad and Mac. In general, aim for a maximum of three.

Keep actions with text labels separate. Placing an action with a text label next to an action with a symbol can create the illusion of a single action with a combined text and symbol, leading to confusion and misinterpretation. If your toolbar includes multiple text-labeled buttons, the text of those buttons may appear to run together, making the buttons indistinguishable. Add separation by inserting fixed space between the buttons. For developer guidance, see UIBarButtonItem.SystemItem.fixedSpace.
