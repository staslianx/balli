- [ ] **Save changes** - Verify edited values persist when saved/closed

### Product Cards in Library
- [ ] **Card design** - Verify products display as rounded squares
- [ ] **Card information** - Check displays: product name, brand, serving size, carb value
- [ ] **Card tap action** - Confirm tapping opens label screen
- [ ] **Edit functionality** - Verify edit button allows value modification
- [ ] **Save changes** - Check if edited values persist

## Feature 4: Serving Size Adjustment System

- [ ] **Slider functionality** - Check slider adjusts serving size and updates values proportionally
- [ ] **Impact score update** - Verify impact score changes with serving size adjustments
- [ ] **Value persistence** - Confirm changes persist between app launches

## Data Persistence Verification

### Cross-Launch Persistence
- [ ] **Recipe edits persist** - Verify recipe modifications survive app restarts
- [ ] **Product edits persist** - Check product/label changes survive app restarts
- [ ] **Card updates** - Confirm front-face card information reflects latest edits
- [ ] **Serving adjustments persist** - Verify serving size changes are maintained

### Library Consistency
- [ ] **Recipe card accuracy** - Check recipe cards show current name, serving size, carb amount
- [ ] **Product card accuracy** - Verify product cards display current name, brand, serving size, carb value
- [ ] **Cross-feature consistency** - Confirm values match between detail views and library cards

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test each feature independently** first, then test interactions between features
2. **Force quit and relaunch** the app between major testing phases to verify persistence
3. **Test edge cases**: empty states, network failures, very long/short content
4. **Verify UI responsiveness** during AI generation and processing states
5. **Check accessibility** features and VoiceOver compatibility where applicable

## Reporting Format

For each checklist item, report:
- ‚úÖ **Working as expected** - Brief confirmation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Partial implementation** - What works, what doesn't
- ‚ùå **Not working/missing** - Clear description of issue
- üîç **Needs investigation** - Unclear behavior that requires further testing

## Priority Issues

Focus special attention on these critical flows:
1. **Data persistence across app launches**
2. **Proper navigation between features and food library**
3. **Serving size slider proportional calculations**
4. **AI generation states and user feedback**
5. **Edit/save cycles in both recipes and products**

Please trace through each feature methodically and provide a comprehensive report on the current implementation status.
