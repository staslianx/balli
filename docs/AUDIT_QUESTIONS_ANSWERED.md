## Question 1: Are tier1-flow, tier2-flow, and flash-flow still used by the router?

### Status: **PARTIALLY ORPHANED**

### Evidence:

**Router Implementation Analysis:**
- File: `/functions/src/flows/router-flow.ts` (382 lines)
- **Does NOT import or reference** tier1-flow, tier2-flow, or flash-flow
- Router directly returns tier numbers (1, 2, or 3) with task summaries
- Router is a **classification-only** component using Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite

**Active Usage Pattern:**
- File: `/functions/src/diabetes-assistant.ts` (lines 12-14)
  ```typescript
  import { flashTier, FlashInput } from './flows/flash-flow';
  import { proResearchTier, ProResearchInput } from './flows/pro-research-flow';
  ```
- This is the **NON-STREAMING** endpoint (`diabetesAssistant`)
- **DEPRECATED ENDPOINT** - superseded by `diabetesAssistantStream`

**Current Production System:**
- File: `/functions/src/diabetes-assistant-stream.ts` (1,476 lines)
- **NO imports** of tier1-flow, tier2-flow, or flash-flow
- Implements its own inline tier logic:
  - `streamTier1()` - Flash model with hybrid memory
  - `streamTier2Hybrid()` - Flash + 15 Exa sources
  - `streamDeepResearch()` - Pro + multi-round research

**Import Locations:**
- `/functions/src/diabetes-assistant.ts` - Lines 13-14 (deprecated non-streaming endpoint)

### Recommendation: **DELETE tier1-flow, tier2-flow, flash-flow**

**Reasoning:**
1. **Router doesn't use them** - Router is just a classifier, not an executor
2. **Streaming endpoint doesn't use them** - Has its own implementation
3. **Only used by deprecated endpoint** - `diabetesAssistant` (non-streaming) is legacy
4. **iOS app uses streaming only** - No client calls the old non-streaming endpoint

**Safe Deletion Plan:**
1. Verify no production traffic to `diabetesAssistant` (non-streaming)
2. Delete `tier1-flow.ts`, `tier2-flow.ts`, `flash-flow.ts`
3. Update `diabetes-assistant.ts` imports or mark endpoint as deprecated
4. Add deprecation notice to non-streaming endpoint

---

## Question 2: Is `research-search.ts` a duplicate of `diabetesAssistantStream`?

### Status: **ORPHANED PROTOTYPE**

### Evidence:

**Functionality Comparison:**

**research-search.ts (874 lines):**
- Implements Gemini Tool Calling with medical/research search tools
- Defines `medicalSourceSearchTool` (Exa medical sources)
- Defines `deepResearchSearchTool` (PubMed, arXiv, ClinicalTrials)
- Returns structured JSON response with answer, sources, strategy
- **NOT exported** in `index.ts`
- Has test file: `test-research-search.js`

**diabetesAssistantStream (1,476 lines):**
- Full production streaming implementation
- SSE (Server-Sent Events) for real-time user feedback
- 3-tier routing system (T1: MODEL, T2: SEARCH, T3: RESEARCH)
- Hybrid memory system (Genkit sessions + vector search)
- Comprehensive reference resolution
- **IS exported** in `index.ts` (line 1721)

**Purpose Overlap:**
- Both fetch medical research
- Both use Exa, PubMed, arXiv, ClinicalTrials
- Both use Gemini models

**Key Differences:**
1. **research-search.ts**: Tool calling prototype, no streaming, simpler
2. **diabetesAssistantStream**: Production system, streaming, memory, routing

**Export Status:**
- `research-search.ts`: **NOT exported in index.ts**
- Endpoint: `researchSearch` (line 807-873 in research-search.ts)
- No evidence of iOS app using this endpoint

**iOS App Check:**
- Searched entire Swift codebase: **ZERO references to "researchSearch"**
- iOS app uses `diabetesAssistantStream` exclusively

### Recommendation: **DELETE research-search.ts**

**Reasoning:**
1. **Not exported** - Endpoint is not accessible
2. **Not called by iOS app** - No client usage
3. **Functionally superseded** - diabetesAssistantStream does everything it does + more
4. **Experimental code** - Appears to be a prototype for tool calling
5. **Maintenance burden** - Keeping duplicates creates confusion

**Files to Delete:**
- `/functions/src/research-search.ts` (874 lines)
- `/functions/test-research-search.js` (test file)
- `/functions/lib/research-search.d.ts` (compiled TypeScript declaration)
- `/functions/lib/research-search.js` (compiled JavaScript)

## Question 3: Are iOS MedicalSearch providers used?

### Status: **ORPHANED - NEVER INTEGRATED**

### Evidence:

**MedicalSearch Provider Implementation:**

Found 5 Swift files implementing medical search:
1. `/balli/Features/MedicalSearch/Services/PubMedProvider.swift`
2. `/balli/Features/MedicalSearch/Services/ExaSearchProvider.swift`
3. `/balli/Features/MedicalSearch/Services/ClinicalTrialsProvider.swift`
4. `/balli/Features/MedicalSearch/Services/MedicalSearchCoordinator.swift`
5. `/balli/Features/MedicalSearch/Services/MedicalSearchService.swift`

**Internal Usage:**
- `MedicalSearchService` instantiates `MedicalSearchCoordinator` (line 28)
- `MedicalSearchCoordinator` instantiates all 3 providers (lines 33-35):
  ```swift
  self.exaProvider = try ExaSearchProvider()
  self.pubmedProvider = PubMedProvider()
  self.clinicalTrialsProvider = ClinicalTrialsProvider()
  ```

**External Usage Check:**

**NO imports in Research feature:**
```bash
Grep "MedicalSearchCoordinator|PubMedProvider|ExaSearchProvider" in Features/Research
Result: No files found
```

**NO usage anywhere in app:**
```bash
Grep "import.*MedicalSearch" in entire iOS codebase
Result: No files found
```

**MedicalSearchService instantiation:**
```bash
Grep "MedicalSearchService" in Features/Research
Result: No files found
```

**Conclusion:**
- MedicalSearch providers are **completely isolated**
- Never imported by Research feature
- Never called by any ViewModel
- **Dead code** - well-structured but unused

### Recommendation: **DELETE ALL iOS MedicalSearch providers**

**Reasoning:**
1. **Zero integration** - Not connected to any active feature
2. **Backend handles research** - All medical searches happen in Firebase Functions
3. **Architecture mismatch** - iOS app uses streaming SSE, not client-side API calls
4. **Redundant implementation** - Backend already has Exa/PubMed/Trials integration
5. **API key security** - Better to keep API keys server-side anyway

**Files to Delete (5 files):**
```
/balli/Features/MedicalSearch/Services/PubMedProvider.swift
/balli/Features/MedicalSearch/Services/ExaSearchProvider.swift
/balli/Features/MedicalSearch/Services/ClinicalTrialsProvider.swift
/balli/Features/MedicalSearch/Services/MedicalSearchCoordinator.swift
/balli/Features/MedicalSearch/Services/MedicalSearchService.swift
```

**Potential Additional Deletions:**
- Check `/balli/Features/MedicalSearch/Models/` for unused model files
- Check `/balli/Features/MedicalSearch/Views/` for unused UI files
- Consider deleting entire `/balli/Features/MedicalSearch/` directory if fully orphaned

## Question 4: Can we delete ALL 90+ build log files?

### Status: **SAFE TO DELETE**

### Evidence:

**Log File Count:**
```bash
find /Users/serhat/SW/balli -name "*.log" -type f | wc -l
Result: 71 files
```

**Sample Logs (first 20 with sizes):**
```
-rw-r--r--@ 1 serhat  staff   156K  absolute_zero_final.log
-rw-r--r--@ 1 serhat  staff   945K  build.log
-rw-r--r--@ 1 serhat  staff   396K  build_ABSOLUTE_ZERO_FINAL.log
-rw-r--r--@ 1 serhat  staff   411K  build_FINAL_ZERO_CHECK.log
-rw-r--r--@ 1 serhat  staff   389K  build_VICTORY.log
-rw-r--r--@ 1 serhat  staff   396K  build_ZERO_VERIFICATION.log
... (65+ more similar files)
```

**Log Types Identified:**
1. **Build logs** - `build*.log` (40+ files)
2. **Test logs** - `test*.log`, `test_output.log`
3. **Deployment logs** - `functions/deploy.log`
4. **NPM errors** - `functions/node_modules/is-arrayish/yarn-error.log`
5. **Firebase debug** - `firebase-debug.log`

**Purpose Analysis:**
- These are **temporary build artifacts**
- Generated during development/debugging sessions
- Names like "VICTORY", "ABSOLUTE_ZERO_FINAL", "zero_check" suggest debugging phases
- **NOT version controlled** (should be in .gitignore)
- **NOT runtime dependencies**

### Recommendation: **DELETE ALL BUILD LOGS**

**Reasoning:**
1. **Temporary artifacts** - Build logs are regenerated on each build
2. **Development debris** - No production or CI/CD value
3. **Waste disk space** - 71 files consuming significant space
4. **Git pollution risk** - Should never be committed

**Safe Deletion Command:**
```bash
# Delete all .log files in project root
rm /Users/serhat/SW/balli/*.log

# Delete NPM error logs
rm /Users/serhat/SW/balli/functions/node_modules/**/*.log

# Keep firebase-debug.log if actively debugging, else delete
```

**Follow-up Action:**
Add to `.gitignore`:
```
# Build logs
*.log
build*.log
test*.log
firebase-debug.log

# Exception: Keep deployment logs in specific CI directories if needed
# !ci/logs/*.log
```

## Question 5: Confirm deletion of `pro-research-flow.ts`?

### Status: **USED BY DEPRECATED ENDPOINT ONLY**

### Evidence:

**Import Locations:**
- `/functions/src/diabetes-assistant.ts` (line 14):
  ```typescript
  import { proResearchTier, ProResearchInput } from './flows/pro-research-flow';
  ```

**Usage Context:**
- File: `diabetes-assistant.ts`
- Endpoint: `diabetesAssistant` (non-streaming, callable function)
- Export: Line 77-300+ (long function)
- **NOT the primary endpoint** - This is the old callable function

**Primary Production Endpoint:**
- File: `diabetes-assistant-stream.ts`
- Export: `diabetesAssistantStream` (line 1272-1475)
- **NO import** of pro-research-flow
- Uses inline `streamDeepResearch()` function instead

**Export Status in index.ts:**
- `diabetesAssistantStream` **IS exported** (line 1721)
- `diabetesAssistant` (non-streaming) status: **UNKNOWN** (need to check if exported)

**Checking if non-streaming endpoint is exported:**
```bash
Grep "export.*pro-research-flow|export.*from.*pro-research" in functions/src
Result: No matches found
```

This means:
- `pro-research-flow.ts` itself is **NOT exported** as a standalone endpoint
- Only used internally by `diabetes-assistant.ts`

**iOS App Usage:**
- iOS app uses **streaming endpoint only** (`diabetesAssistantStream`)
- No evidence of calls to non-streaming `diabetesAssistant`

### Recommendation: **SAFE TO DELETE (with caveat)**

**Status: CONDITIONAL DELETE**

**Delete if:**
1. Non-streaming `diabetesAssistant` endpoint is deprecated
2. No production traffic to `diabetesAssistant` (verify in Firebase Console)
3. All clients migrated to streaming endpoint

**Keep if:**
1. Legacy clients still use non-streaming endpoint
2. Fallback mechanism for streaming failures

**Verification Steps Before Deletion:**
1. Check Firebase Functions logs for `diabetesAssistant` invocations
2. Verify iOS app only calls `diabetesAssistantStream`
3. Check if any other platforms (web, Android) use non-streaming

**Files to Delete:**
- `/functions/src/flows/pro-research-flow.ts`
- `/functions/src/flows/flash-flow.ts` (also only used by deprecated endpoint)
- `/functions/src/flows/tier1-flow.ts` (if exists)
- `/functions/src/flows/tier2-flow.ts` (if exists)

**Migration Path:**
If you want to deprecate cleanly:
1. Add deprecation warning to `diabetesAssistant` endpoint
2. Monitor usage for 2 weeks
3. If zero traffic, delete deprecated endpoint + its flows
4. If traffic exists, add redirect to streaming endpoint

## Recommended Deletion Order

### Phase 1: Zero Risk (Immediate)
1. **Delete all build logs** (71 files) - 100% safe, immediate space savings
2. **Delete iOS MedicalSearch** (5+ files) - Never integrated, zero usage

### Phase 2: Low Risk (After Verification)
3. **Delete research-search.ts** (4 files) - Not exported, verify no hidden callers
4. **Delete tier flows** (3 files) - Only used by deprecated endpoint

### Phase 3: Requires Traffic Analysis
5. **Delete pro-research-flow.ts** (1 file) - After confirming deprecated endpoint has zero traffic
